        <p class="govuk-body">If you’re thinking about getting into the construction industry at technician level or going to university to study a degree in subjects such as civil engineering, architecture, surveying or construction management, this work related course could be for you. It will give you a broad overview of the construction industry from the initial planning stage through to the design and building process of housing, industrial and commercial buildings. The diploma is equivalent to 2 A levels.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Entry requirements</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">You'll need 4 GCSEs at grade 4 or above including English, maths and science or a relevant level 2 qualification.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What you'll learn</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">You’ll learn the essential health and safety requirements for working in construction and explore sustainable building techniques, looking at the ways that construction projects work to minimise their impact on the natural environment. You’ll explore the properties of building materials and the techniques used to make sure they are capable of withstanding the forces that act on structures. You’ll develop your maths skills, learning to apply geometric, trigonometric, graphical and statistical techniques to solve practical construction problems. You’ll get experience of using manual and computer aided drawing techniques and learn how to communicate design ideas to the wider construction team. There are optional units covering a range of topics including surveying, project management, building regulations, planning procedures and civil engineering among others.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How you'll learn</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">Through a mixture of classroom, design workshop and construction site activities. There will be industry visits, events and speakers and the chance to do some work experience.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What you'll need to bring</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">A scale rule and adjustable set square. You’ll also need to purchase set text books.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How you'll be assessed</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">Through written assignments, practical observation and written tests throughout the course.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Next steps</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">You could enter technician level employment, a higher or degree apprenticeship in areas such as civil engineering, quantity surveying, town planning, construction management or architecture or move on to a construction related HNC/HND, foundation degree or degree course.</p>
