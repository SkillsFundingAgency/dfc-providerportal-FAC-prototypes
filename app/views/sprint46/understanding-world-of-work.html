          <p class="govuk-body">Get to know how the labour market works to help you to make realistic and informed career decisions.</p>
			<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Labour market information explained</h2>
			<p class="govuk-body">Labour market information (LMI) is everything we can measure and analyse about the world of work. It covers information that can tell us things like:</p>
			<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
			  <li>what jobs exist and in what sectors</li>
			  <li>which regions have the most jobs in a specific sector</li>
			  <li>which jobs are growing in demand or likely to disappear in the future</li>
			  <li>what skills and qualifications employers need</li>
			  <li>facts about equality and diversity at work</li>
			  <li>how much people earn, their hours, where and how they work</li>

			</ul>
			
          <p class="govuk-body">Labour market information comes from lots of different sources like government and industry surveys, reports from professional bodies or organisations that deal with specific groups of people for example, graduates, women or people with a disability. The facts and figures can sometimes be hard to understand.  Careers advice professionals spend a lot of time interpreting labour market information in a way that can be meaningful and useful to you. 
</p><h3 class="govuk-heading-m">How labour market information can help</h3>
			<p class="govuk-body">Labour market information can help when you’re thinking about questions like:</p>
			<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">

</li>
				<li>if I take this course will I get a job at the end?</li>
				<li>how much will I get paid when I’ve been doing this job for a few years?</li>
				<li>will I need to move area to do this career?</li>
				<li>will this job still be around in 10 years’ time?</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p class="govuk-body">Accurate and up to date information on the world of work can help you to decide on the right career path for you and your circumstances.
